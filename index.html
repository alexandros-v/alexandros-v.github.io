<!-- I wanted to incorporate a series of lists and associated images to break up
the long string of text. I wanted to keep things and light and visual while still 
retaining the theme of a resume. I broke the lists and its listed items into classes
so as to center them on the page beneath their relevant images. I did this using CSS.
